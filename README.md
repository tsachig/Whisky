- **üéÆ Gaming-Focused**: Repositioned as a Windows gaming emulator
- **üìö Complete Documentation**: Comprehensive gaming guides and setup instructions  
- **üõ†Ô∏è Modernized Codebase**: Swift 6 compatibility and build system updates
- **üåü Community Ready**: Gaming issue templates and compatibility reporting
- **‚ö° Gaming Optimized**: Enhanced DXVK, msync tuning, and Metal performance improvements

üëâ **[See Gaming Improvements Guide](GAMING-IMPROVEMENTS.md)** üëà

### üéÆ **Gaming-Focused Windows Emulator**

**Whisky** provides a native macOS interface for running Windows games on Apple Silicon Macs with optimized gaming performance through Wine, DXVK-macOS, D3DMetal, and Apple's Game Porting Toolkit.

## System Requirements
- CPU: Apple Silicon (M-series chips)
- OS: macOS Sonoma 14.0 or later

## Homebrew

Whisky is on homebrew! Install with 
`brew install --cask whisky`.

## üéÆ Gaming Support & Compatibility

### Gaming Performance Improvements
- **Enhanced DirectX 10/11**: DXVK enabled by default for better compatibility and reduced stuttering
- **Apple Silicon Optimization**: msync tuning and memory enhancements for native performance  
- **Metal Performance**: Enhanced Metal HUD with logging for real-time monitoring
- **Startup Optimization**: Cached DXVK setup for faster game launches

### Gaming Configuration
- **DXVK (Enabled by Default)**: Improves DirectX 10/11 compatibility and reduces stuttering
- **DXVK Async**: Smoother shader compilation for gaming
- **Metal HUD**: Real-time gaming performance monitoring with frame rate, GPU usage, and memory metrics
- **Enhanced Sync**: Apple Silicon-optimized msync for gaming
- **Process Elevation**: "Run as Administrator" for games requiring it

**üí° Gaming Tip**: DXVK is enabled by default to improve compatibility and reduce stuttering. Performance gains vary by game - some well-optimized games like Baldur's Gate 3 may not see significant FPS improvements. You can disable DXVK in bottle settings if needed.

### Game Compatibility
Some games need special configuration. Check out:
- **[Gaming Wiki](https://github.com/IsaacMarovitz/Whisky/wiki/Game-Support)** - Game-specific setup guides
- **[Gaming Performance Improvements](GAMING-IMPROVEMENTS.md)** - Gaming optimizations and setup guide
- **Gaming Performance**: Use Metal HUD and DXVK HUD for optimization
