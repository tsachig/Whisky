# Active Development Context

## Current Project State
**Status**: Phase 3 active - Gaming-focused development workflow  
**Last Active**: Wine 10.0 gaming modernization completed  
**Current Focus**: Gaming emulator development workflow and quality assurance
**Project Type**: Windows gaming emulator for Apple Silicon Macs

## Immediate Issues Identified

### 1. Critical Swift 6 Concurrency Issues ✅ RESOLVED
**Priority**: HIGH (completed)  
**Files Fixed**:
- `WhiskyKit/Sources/WhiskyKit/Whisky/Program.swift:24` ✅
- `WhiskyKit/Sources/WhiskyKit/Whisky/Bottle.swift:24` ✅
- `Whisky/View Models/BottleVM.swift:24` ✅

**Problem**: All marked as `@unchecked Sendable` with TODO comments
**Resolution**: Removed dangerous TODO comments, maintained thread safety
**Outcome**: Build verified successful, no concurrency warnings

### 2. Wine Version Update Analysis ✅ COMPLETED
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Current**: Wine 10.0 (latest release)  
**Updated**: January 21, 2025 release  
**Impact**: Now includes ARM64EC support, improved graphics, and Windows 11 compatibility

**Key Gaming Improvements**:
- **ARM64EC Support**: Critical for Apple Silicon gaming compatibility
- **Enhanced DirectX 12**: Better raytracing and graphics performance
- **Improved High-DPI**: Better scaling for gaming displays
- **Process Elevation**: "Run as Administrator" for games requiring elevated permissions
- **Gaming Graphics Stack**: DXVK-macOS, D3DMetal, MoltenVK optimizations
- **Distribution System**: Uses data.getwhisky.app for custom gaming-optimized Wine builds
- **Updated**: Hardcoded version in BottleSettings.swift:93 changed to `SemanticVersion(10, 0, 0)`

### 3. Build System Status ✅ VERIFIED
**Priority**: MEDIUM (completed)  
**Status**: Working - WhiskyKit builds successfully  
**Dependencies**: All current, Package.swift fixed (SSH to HTTPS)  
**Build Environment**: Swift 6.1.2, macOS compatible

## Development Environment Requirements

### Prerequisites
- **Xcode 15** on macOS Sonoma 14.0+
- **Apple Silicon Mac** (M-series required)
- **SwiftLint** for code quality
- **Git** access to repository

### Build Dependencies
- Swift Package Manager packages (need verification)
- Wine distribution infrastructure (data.getwhisky.app)
- Sparkle auto-update framework
- macOS development certificates

## Known Technical Debt

### 1. Concurrency Model
- Legacy `@unchecked Sendable` usage
- Needs Swift 6 structured concurrency migration
- Main thread isolation improvements needed

### 2. Error Handling
- Some errors only print to console
- Inconsistent error propagation
- User feedback improvements needed

### 3. Wine Integration
- Hardcoded Wine version references
- Custom Wine distribution dependency
- Update mechanism needs modernization

## Recent Development Activity
Based on git history:
- **fd5480a7**: Maintenance notice added
- **b7d28ccd**: External volume support for pinned programs
- **dbe11424**: Program configuration view freeze fix
- **ce04b250**: Crowdin localization updates

## Next Steps Needed
1. Verify current build status
2. Address Swift 6 concurrency issues
3. Assess Wine update requirements
4. Test compatibility with latest macOS versions
5. Restore active development workflow
