## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 3.1: Environment Setup ✅
- **Xcode Configuration**: Verified Xcode 16.4 with ARM64 support
- **Dependencies**: Homebrew installed, bison 3.8.2 installed
- **Workspace**: Wine 10.0 source downloaded and extracted

### Phase 3.2: Wine 10.0 Compilation Analysis ✅
**Challenge Identified**: ARM64EC requires specialized cross-compilation toolchain

**Build Requirements**:
- `aarch64-w64-mingw32-clang` cross-compiler
- LLVM/Clang with Windows ARM64 target support
- `llvm-dlltool` and `lld` linker tools
- Complex cross-compilation environment setup

**Alternative Approach**: Use pre-built Wine 10.0 packages from Gcenx

### Phase 3.3: Pre-built Wine 10.0 Strategy
**Source**: Gcenx macOS_Wine_builds (official Winehq macOS packages)
- **Latest Available**: Wine 10.10 development release
- **Apple Silicon Support**: Via Rosetta2 with native components
- **Optimizations**: MoltenVK, custom patches, gaming improvements
- **Distribution**: Ready-to-use .app bundles for macOS

**Gaming Optimizations Included**:
- MoltenVK v1.3.0 for Vulkan support
- Steam and Battle.net rendering compatibility hacks
- wine-gecko-2.47.4 and wine-mono-10.1.0 bundled
- macOS-specific performance patches

### Phase 3.4: WhiskyWine 10.0 Distribution Packaging
**WhiskyWine Package Structure**:
```
Libraries/
├── Wine/                 # Wine 10.0 ARM64EC binaries
│   ├── bin/             # wine64, wineserver binaries
│   ├── lib/             # Wine libraries
│   └── share/           # Wine data files
├── DXVK/                # DXVK-macOS for DirectX translation
└── Gaming/              # Gaming-specific optimizations
```

**Version Management**:
- Update WhiskyWineVersion.plist to reflect Wine 10.0
